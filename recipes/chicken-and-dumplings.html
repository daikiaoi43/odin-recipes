    <h2>This chicken and dumplings casserole is comfort food at its best.</h2>
    <p>
      Pretty good recipe overall and easy to make. I added a little salt and
      pepper but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Definitely will save this
      recipe.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into small pieces</li>
      <li>1 cup sliced carrot</li>
      <li>½ cup sliced celery</li>
      <li>1 cube chicken bouillon, or more to taste</li>
      <li>⅓ cup butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large baking
        dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine chicken, carrot, celery, and bouillon in a large pot and add
        enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook until chicken is
        no longer pink in the centers, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain, reserving
        chicken and broth in another pot or bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in the same pot over medium heat. Cook onion and garlic in
        the hot butter for 5 minutes. Stir in flour, poultry seasoning, basil,
        thyme, and pepper. Stir in chicken broth and milk slowly. Add chicken
        mixture and peas. Simmer over medium-low heat until thick, 10 to 15
        minutes. Pour mixture into the prepared baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until mixture is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.
        Remove from the oven and place biscuits on top. Cover and bake for 15
        minutes. Uncover and continue baking until biscuits are golden brown, 15
        to 20 minutes more.
      </li>
    </ol>
